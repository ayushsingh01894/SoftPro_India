"""
Anatomy of a good prompt -- assemble the four pieces into one (no API key needed).

Today's techniques are not rivals; they STACK:
  role (system) + clear task (zero-shot) + examples (few-shot) + reasoning (CoT).

This script builds a message list from those parts and prints it, so you can see
the shape of a solid prompt before you send it. It makes no API call -- it just
shows the structure. Drop the returned 'messages' straight into Groq.

Run:
    python prompt_builder.py
